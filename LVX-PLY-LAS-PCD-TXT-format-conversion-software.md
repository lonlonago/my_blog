Because point cloud data in these formats are used in work, sometimes it needs to be converted to each other in batches, so such a tool is made. If you don’t know what las and pcd are, then you don’t need to read it, because this software It's useless to you, without too much introduction, just take a screenshot to see the interface, the function is very simple, it is to batch convert files in these formats.

Since a friend of the invoice software released last time reminded me that there was a Trojan horse detected after downloading it, I am sorry, I don’t know if it was caused by a false alarm or a poisonous U disk inserted in my own computer, so this time I also specifically used 360 to detect it. Once again, clear! Please rest assured to use. The downloading of the previous invoice software has been suspended. Whether it is a false alarm or not, to avoid accidental injury, friends who have already downloaded and used it before should also use anti-virus software or 360 to check it out. If there is a Trojan horse, it is recommended to delete it in time. This friend’s habit is very good. It is recommended to use anti-virus software to check after downloading the program in the future, and you can directly contact me for the correct version.
