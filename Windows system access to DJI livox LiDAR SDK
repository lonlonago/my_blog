Windows system access to DJI LiDAR SDK
 
DJI's official SDK is relatively lazy, only a brief description is written in the part of connecting lidar in windows, and finally the part of how to obtain a frame of data is not written. . It hurts so much, so I patched it up to see the effect.



The result can be seen here:

The specific process of DJI radar is more troublesome than other radars. It requires a UDP communication handshake process. Other radars directly send data to the target machine.


Subsequent receiving data, displaying data, and saving data is more convenient.
